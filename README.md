# no-conflict.vim

When both file on disk and vim's buffer are changed you'll be presented with
this:

![annoying scenario](/file_changed.png)

Interruption, annoying, not nice.

This plugin will make the situation better by preventing the interruption, and
instead you'll be presented with just a message:

![nice message](/nice_message.png)
